<p><strong>[photo will be added soon]</strong></p>
<p>This App is a Toy project that I made during taking Android course on Udacity. This App is really simple. It reads JSON data from the web(the url was provided from Udacity), which contains 4 different recipes. Content includes the food name, ingredients name, cooking steps, and cooking video files and etc.</p>
<h2 id="master---detail-flow-in-tablet-mode">Master - Detail flow in Tablet mode</h2>
<p>In this project, I was required to make a Tablet version, which displays the detail information in Master - Detail flow. Right hand side are names of recipes and steps, and left hand side is the currently selected step’s video and step details.</p>
<h2 id="simpleexoplayer">SimpleExoPlayer</h2>
<p>The mp4 files of the step details were displayed using SimpleExoPlayer. The Player survives orientation change, and upon orientation change the app saves current playback position.</p>
<h2 id="collection-view-widget">Collection View Widget</h2>
<p>I also made a widget that displays user selected recipe’s ingredients. On users’ click of “display this on homescreen”, the widget is updated with a list of ingredients.</p>
